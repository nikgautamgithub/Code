          Competitive programming combines two topics: (1) the design of
          algorithms and (2) the implementation of algorithms.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Design of algorithms consists of problem solving and
                mathematical thinking. Skills for analyzing problems and solving
                them creatively are needed. An algorithm for solving a problem
                has to be both correct and efficient, and the core of the
                problem is often about inventing an efficient algorithm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Theoretical knowledge of algorithms is important to competitive
                programmers. Typically, a solution to a problem is a combination
                of well-known techniques and new insights. The techniques that
                appear in competitive programming also form the basis for the
                scientific research of algorithms.

            <li>
              <p>
                The implementation of algorithms requires good programming
                skills. In competitive programming, the solutions are graded by
                testing an implemented algorithm using a set of test cases.
                Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the algorithm is
                correct, but the implementation also has to be correct.

                A good coding style in contests is straightforward and concise.
                Programs should be written quickly, because there is not much
                time available. Unlike in traditional software engineering, the
                programs are short (usually at most a few hundred lines of
                code), and they do not need to be maintained after the contest.

        <article>
          <p>
            At the moment, the most popular programming languages used in
            contests are C++, Python and Java. For example, in Google Code Jam
            2017, among the best 3,000 participants, 79 % used C++, 16 % used
            Python and 8 % used Java [29]. Some participants also used several
            languages. Many people think that C++ is the best choice for a
            competitive programmer, and C++ is nearly always available in
            contest systems. The benefits of using C++ are that it is a very
            efficient language and its standard library contains a large
            collection of data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, it
            is good to master several languages and understand their strengths.
            For example, if large integers are needed in the problem, Python can
            be a good choice, because it contains built-in operations for
            calculating with large integers. Still, most problems in programming
            contests are set so that using a specific programming language is
            not an unfair advantage. All example programs in this Documentation
            are written in C++, and the standard library’s data structures and
            algorithms are often used. The programs follow the C++11 standard,
            which can be used in most contests nowadays. If you cannot program
            in C++ yet, now is a good time to start learning.

      <section class="main-section" id="C++_code_template">
        <header>C++ code template</header>
        <article>
          A typical C++ code template for competitive programming looks like
          this:
          <code
            >#include < bits/stdc++.h > using namespace std; int main() { //
            solution comes here }
          </code>
          <p>
            The #include line at the beginning of the code is a feature of the
            g++ compiler that allows us to include the entire standard library.
            Thus, it is not needed to separately include libraries such as
            iostream, vector and algorithm, but rather they are available
            automatically. The using line declares that the classes and
            functions of the standard library can be used directly in the code.
            Without the using line we would have to write, for example,
            std::cout, but now it suffices to write cout. The code can be
            compiled using the following command:
          </p>
          <code> g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test </code>
          This command produces a binary file test from the source code
          test.cpp. The compiler follows the C++11 standard (-std=c++11),
          optimizes the code (-O2) and shows warnings about possible errors
          (-Wall).

        <header>Input and output</header>
        <article>
          In most contests, standard streams are used for reading input and
          writing output. In C++, the standard streams are cin for input and
          cout for output. In addition, the C functions scanf and printf can be
          used. The input for the program usually consists of numbers and
          strings that are separated with spaces and newlines. They can be read
          from the cin stream as follows:
          <code> int a, b; string x; cin >> a >> b >> x; </code>
          This kind of code always works, assuming that there is at least one
          space or newline between each element in the input. For example, the
          above code can read both of the following inputs:
          <code> 123 456 monkey 123 &emsp; 456 monkey </code>
          The cout stream is used for output as follows:
          <code
            >int a = 123, b = 456; string x = "monkey"; cout << a << " " << b
            <<" " << x << "\n";</code

      <section class="main-section" id="Shortening_code">
        <header>Shortening code</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Short code is ideal in competitive programming, because programs
            should be written as fast as possible. Because of this, competitive
            programmers often define shorter names for datatypes and other parts
            of code.
          </p>
          <li class="subheading">Type Names</li>

          Using the command <code>typedef</code> it is possible to give a
          shorter name to a datatype. For example, the name
          <code>long long</code> is long, so we can define a shorter name ll:

          <code> typedef long long ll; </code>

          After this, the code

          <code
            >long long a = 123456789; long long b = 987654321; cout << a*b <<
            "\n";
          </code>

          can be shortened as follows:

          <code>ll a = 123456789; ll b = 987654321; cout << a*b << "\n"; </code>

          The command typedef can also be used with more complex types. For
          example, the following code gives the name <code>vi</code> for a
          vector of integers and the name <code>pi</code> for a pair that
          contains two integers.

          <code> typedef vector< int > vi; typedef pair< int,int > pi; </code>

          <li class="subheading">Macros</li>

          Another way to shorten code is to define macros. A macro means that
          certain strings in the code will be changed before the compilation. In
          C++, macros are defined using the <code>#define</code> keyword. For
          example, we can define the following macros:

          <code
            >#define F first #define S second #define PB push_back #define MP
            make_pair
          </code>

          After this, the code

          <code
            >v.push_back(make_pair(y1,x1)); v.push_back(make_pair(y2,x2)); int d
            = v[i].first+v[i].second;
          </code>

          can be shortened as follows:

          <code>v.PB(MP(y1,x1)); v.PB(MP(y2,x2)); int d = v[i].F+v[i].S; </code>

          A macro can also have parameters which makes it possible to shorten
          loops and other structures. For example, we can define the following
          macro:

          <code> #define REP(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) </code>

          After this, the code

          <code> for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { search(i); } </code>

          can be shortened as follows:

          <code> REP(i,1,n) { search(i); } </code>

          Sometimes macros cause bugs that may be difficult to detect. For
          example, consider the following macro that calculates the square of a
          number:

          <code> #define SQ(a) a*a </code>

          This macro does not always work as expected. For example, the code

          <code> cout << SQ(3+3) << "\n"; </code>

          corresponds to the code

          <code> cout << 3+3*3+3 << "\n"; // 15 </code>

          A better version of the macro is as follows:

          <code> #define SQ(a) (a)*(a) </code>

          Now the code

          <code> cout << SQ(3+3) << "\n"; </code>

          corresponds to the code

          <code> cout << (3+3)*(3+3) << "\n"; // 36 </code>

                IOI The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) is an annual
                programming contest for secondary school students. Each country
                is allowed to send a team of four students to the contest. There
                are usually about 300 participants from 80 countries. The IOI
                consists of two five-hour long contests. In both contests, the
                participants are asked to solve three algorithm tasks of various
                difficulty. The tasks are divided into subtasks, each of which
                has an assigned score. Even if the contestants are divided into
                teams, they compete as individuals. The IOI syllabus regulates
                the topics that may appear in IOI tasks. Participants for the
                IOI are selected through national contests. Before the IOI, many
                regional contests are organized, such as the Baltic Olympiad in
                Informatics (BOI), the Central European Olympiad in Informatics
                (CEOI) and the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO). Some
                countries organize online practice contests for future IOI
                participants, such as the Croatian Open Competition in
                Informatics and the USA Computing Olympiad. In addition, a large
                collection of problems from Polish contests is available online.

                ICPC The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is
                an annual programming contest for university students. Each team
                in the contest consists of three students, and unlike in the
                IOI, the students work together; there is only one computer
                available for each team. The ICPC consists of several stages,
                and finally the best teams are invited to the World Finals.
                While there are tens of thousands of participants in the
                contest, there are only a small number2 of final slots
                available, so even advancing to the finals is a great
                achievement in some regions. In each ICPC contest, the teams
                have five hours of time to solve about ten algorithm problems. A
                solution to a problem is accepted only if it solves all test
                cases efficiently. During the contest, competitors may view the
                results of other
